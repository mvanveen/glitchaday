:warning: makefile doesn't _quite_ work 100% yet. 

depends on `gifsicle`, `imagemagick` and `phantomjs` as well

I'm drawing inspiration from today's glitch gif by being in San Diego while 
it is raining.  I grew up here.  We're notorious for our perfect weather.  
The highways break down into a post-apocaylptic pile up as drivers slip off
of oily the assphault which is washing off months of accumulated hydrocarbons.

Nevertheless, the weather here is pretty ideal.  Even rainy days like this would be considered 
mild in any other locale.  Palm trees in the rain remind me of the holidays.

So it is palm trees that speak to me tonight.
